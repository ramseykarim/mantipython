v3 is v1 but cleaner, a nice clean rewrite
v3 successfully implements multiprocessing and can run with any number
of available cores

v3 supports 70/100 micron PACS as well. v3 focuses on single-component, so
for now, does not support multicomponent. It supports fitting variable beta,
either with tau at 160um or with kappa at some reference frequency. It can
also use a dust model (though that cannot be a fit parameter)
