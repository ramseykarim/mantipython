v1 is the helpss-branched version of mantipython.

The version history of mantipython looks something like:
v0: a long time ago, was rather unstructured, a lot of assumptions about
  the source model. Functional but not object oriented.
  The git commit history for this version is in the helpss repository, not
  the mantipython repository.

v1: object-oriented rewrite of v0, more similar to the structure of Kevin's
  manticore (Greybody, Dust, etc.). This is the first version in the
  dedicated mantipython repository.

v2: will replace v1, can be found in the mantipython repository as v1/*.py
  while under development. The goal is to parallelize this.
