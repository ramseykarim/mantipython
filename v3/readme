v3 is v1 but cleaner, just a nice clean rewrite
v3 does not attempt multiprocessing, it leaves all that to numpy/scipy
it seems that attempting multiprocessing while using these functions
makes things difficult, so I will not try that for now

v3 supports 70/100 micron PACS as well. v3 focuses on single-component, so
for now, does not support multicomponent
